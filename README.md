iBooks Ereader Detector
=======================

EPUB 3 file that uses media queries to identify which iBooks platform is in use.

Download the file ibooks_ereader_detector.epub and load to iBooks for iPhone/iPad/Desktop. iBooks will display
text indicating which of these platforms is in use, and (when possible) whether iBooks is in portrait, landscape,
or two-up mode, e.g.

> You are likely reading this ebook
> * On iBooks for iPad
> * In portrait mode

See epub.css file for annotated list of media queries used. Please feel free to make issues to report bugs and
submit pull requests to suggest improvements
