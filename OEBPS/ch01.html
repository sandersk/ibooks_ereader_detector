        <hr />
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional
          intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for
          it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the house-tops, and fiercely
          agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness. Through one
          of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the
          police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders, was wending his solitary way. He stopped
          twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description correspondent with the
          appearance of the quartier in which they were situated, and tended inquiry for some
          article or another which did not seem easily to be met with. All the answers he received
          were couched in the negative; and as he turned from each door he muttered to himself, in
          no very elegant phraseology, his disappointment and discontent. At length, at one house,
          the landlord, a sturdy butcher, after rendering the same reply the inquirer had hitherto
          received, added, "But if this vill do as vell, Dummie, it is quite at your sarvice!"
          Pausing reflectively for a moment, Dummie responded that he thought the thing proffered
          might do as well; and thrusting it into his ample pocket, he strode away with as rapid a
          motion as the wind and the rain would allow. He soon came to a nest of low and dingy
          buildings, at the entrance to which, in half-effaced characters, was written "Thames
          Court." Halting at the most conspicuous of these buildings, an inn or alehouse, through
          the half-closed windows of which blazed out in ruddy comfort the beams of the hospitable
          hearth, he knocked hastily at the door. He was admitted by a lady of a certain age, and
          endowed with a comely rotundity of face and person.</p>
        <p>"Hast got it, Dummie?" said she, quickly, as she closed the door on the guest.</p>
        <p>"Noa, noa! not exactly; but I thinks as 'owâ€”"</p>
